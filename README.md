# Distributed Auction System
 
Auction System using Remote Method Invocation (RMI) 🛍️💰🔒🔁
=============================================================

This repository contains the code for a secure and dependable Auction System developed as part of my JAVA programming coursework. The Auction System utilizes Remote Method Invocation (RMI) calls to enable buyers to bid on items listed by sellers, while ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission through the implementation of encryption techniques. The system also utilizes passive replication for improved dependability, replicating the server as a backup to ensure system availability in the event of server failure. 🚀

Features 💡
-----------

-   Enables buyers to bid on items listed by sellers 💰

-   Utilizes passive replication techniques for system dependability 🔁
-   Provides practical experience in developing secure and dependable distributed systems 💻

Technology Stack 🛠️
--------------------

-   Java ☕
-   Remote Method Invocation (RMI) 🤝
-   Encryption Techniques 🔒
-   Passive Replication Techniques 🔁

Instructions for Running the Project 🚀
---------------------------------------

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine. 🔍
2.  Import the project into your Java IDE of choice. 🛠️
3.  Run the server by executing the `Server.java` file. 🏭
4.  Run the client by executing the `Client.java` file. 🏢
5.  Interact with the Auction System through the client interface(CLI). 💻

Implementation Details 📝
-------------------------

The Auction System was developed using Java and RMI technology. The system architecture consisted of a server and multiple clients, with communication between them facilitated by RMI. The system utilized encryption techniques to secure communication and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmission. 🔒

The system also utilized passive replication techniques to ensure system dependability. The server was replicated as a backup, and in the event of server failure, the backup server would take over. This ensured that the system remained available to clients even in the event of server failure. 🔁

The Auction System interface provided an intuitive and user-friendly experience to buyers and sellers. Buyers could browse items listed by sellers, place bids, and track the status of their bids. Sellers could list items for auction, monitor the status of their auctions, and receive notifications when bids were placed on their items. 🛍️

Future Work 🔮
--------------

The Auction System could be further improved by incorporating additional security features such as user authentication and authorization. The system could also be extended to include features such as real-time bidding, automatic bidding, and messaging between buyers and sellers. Additionally, the system could be scaled to handle larger volumes of data and user traffic. 💡
